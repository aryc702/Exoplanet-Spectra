Exoplanet Spectrum Generator and Parameter Recovery

A first-order model for generating exoplanet spectra and recovering information from observed spectra is presented here. It is NOT a high-fidelity model as many approximations are made, and more subtle factors are completely ignored. It should only serve as an educational introduction to this topic.

This repository has 3 main components:
1. The spectrum generator (generates model spectra based on input parameters)
3. Parameter recovery (determines values for parameters based on an observed spectrum)
4. Linelist files (separate folder, sample files already in the correct format for use by the code)

Both .py files contain instructions on what values to input. A document describing the required format for the linelist files is located in the "Linelist files" folder as well. 

A paper detailing the methods used by the codes is also available as a pdf.
